# COVID Date

Do you want to know how many Marches there have been this year?  Do you also want to know how far we are through the current March?  Then this is the tool for you.

```
covid-date on  master is 📦 v0.1.0 via 🦀 v1.43.1 took 4s
❯ covid-date
It is the 7th of the 5th March of the year of COVID
```

## Building

Get the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs), then run `cargo build` from the root.  After that you can put the binary wherever you want (it will be in `target/debug/covid-date`).
